<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Little</span> Emma was one Sabbath evening
alone in the room with her grandmamma.
Good old Mrs Allan (for that was her grandmother’s
name) was seated in her arm‐chair,
beside a blazing winter fire. A small table
was before her, with a Bible and a pair of
spectacles lying upon it.</p>

<p class='c017'>Emma came jumping up upon her grandmamma’s
knee, and kissed her, and said—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dear grandmamma, there is much in that
large Bible I do not understand; I should
like so much to know all it tells about. When
I was at church this forenoon, I heard Mr R.,
our clergyman, speak to the people about what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>he called ‘doctrines;’ and when he was telling
about them, there were many things the
people liked to hear which were too difficult
for me. Do you think you could tell me
about them in very simple words, and make
them plain to me? I will promise to be very
attentive to all that you say.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall be truly happy,” said the other,
looking with a kindly smile on her little grandchild,
“to do what you ask me. And if you
will come to me for a few minutes every Sabbath
night, I will try to explain these Bible
doctrines to you as simply as I can.”</p>

<p class='c017'>So saying, she put aside her spectacles,
and drawing her chair closer by the fire, with
her arm round little Emma’s neck, began as
follows:—</p>

<h3 id='first' class='c018'>FIRST NIGHT.</h3>

<p class='c019'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of the Being of God.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “There was a time, my
dear child, far, far back in
eternity, when no one lived
but the Great God, when no angel waved his
wing, and no star glittered in the sky.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This ever‐living God did not need angels
or worlds to make Him happy. He was
quite glorious without them.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>“This great Being was <em>one</em> God; but there
were three persons in the Godhead—God the
Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
Ghost. Of these, there was none higher or
greater than the other; they were all equal
in power and in glory.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of the Creation of all things.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “This Great God resolved
on making angels and
worlds; and He just said,
‘I wish them to be,’ and they were all made
by the word of His power. And it was not a
few that He made, but a very great many.
He made large armies of angels; and such a
number of stars and worlds, that they cannot
be counted.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of our World.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Among these crowded
worlds which you see in
the dark sky at night, there was a very little
one—so little, as scarcely to be seen or
noticed amid those around it.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This little star was called ‘<em>the Earth</em>;’
and God loved it very much, and the Three
Persons in the Godhead resolved to do something
very wonderful with regard to it. God
put a happy and holy creature into it, called
<em>Man</em>; and He made him after His own
image, and placed him in a beautiful garden.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of the Covenant of Works.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “While there, God entered
with man into what
is called a <em>Covenant of
Works</em>.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What does a <em>covenant</em> mean?” inquired
Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall tell you, my child,” said her grandmamma.
“It is an agreement, or bargain,
between two people. In the garden of Eden,
the two parties were God and Adam; their
covenant or agreement was this;—God said
to Adam, ‘If you do what I ask you, you
shall live and be happy. If you disobey me,
you must “surely die.”’</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of the Fall.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “God told him not to eat
of the fruit of one of the trees
in the garden; but though Adam had all the
rest of the trees in Eden to eat of, he forgot
God’s command, and took of the forbidden
one; and he was driven out of his happy
home, and became a lost and ruined creature.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“How sad for poor Adam,” said Emma,
“to be banished from his beautiful garden!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes,” said the other; “and sadder still to
be banished from his God, with nothing before
him but certain death!”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“But how was it, grandmamma,” inquired
Emma, “that Adam did not die all at once?
How did he continue to live after God had
said that, if he disobeyed Him, he should
‘surely die’?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I was just going to explain this to you,
my dear,” said Mrs Allan. “Our first parents
could not have lived for one moment after their
‘Fall,’ if it had not been for another and more
glorious covenant the Bible tells us of.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And what was the name of that covenant?”
inquired Emma, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It was called <em>the Covenant of Grace</em>,”
replied her grandmother. “I shall try, my
dear child,” continued she, patting her grandchild
on the head, “to make this very great
and glorious subject as simple as I can to
you; and after you hear me, you will, perhaps,
be able to explain it to others.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Little Emma was again very attentive,
and her grandmamma proceeded:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of the Parties in the Covenant of Grace.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “I want to see, before I
begin, if my little scholar
remembers what I have
just been telling her,—who the two parties
were in the <em>Covenant of Works</em>?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“God and Adam,” replied Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“Yes, dear, you are right. And in this
new covenant or agreement I am going to
speak about, there were two parties also. Do
you think you could tell me who they were?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Was it God and Adam again?” inquired
the little girl.</p>

<p class='c017'>“No, my child,” said the old lady. “Man,
having broken the first covenant, could no
longer enter into terms with God. There
was some one who came in the place of guilty
man. Can you tell me who this was?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It was the Lord Jesus Christ,” said
Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Quite correct,” replied her grandmother.
“God was angry with man, and could no
longer speak with him. But Jesus said, ‘<em>I</em>
will come in the room of those lost sinners,
and speak to God <em>for</em> them.’ So God and
Jesus made a covenant together. It was as
if Jesus said to God, ‘O my Father, if Thou
wilt pardon these poor sinners, I will leave
my glorious throne, and come down to the
earth, and die for them, and wash their guilty
souls in my precious blood.’ And then God
promised, and said, ‘I <em>will</em> pardon them!
They deserve nothing but wrath; but, for the
sake of what Thou art to do and suffer, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>their Redeemer, I will shew them “<em>Grace</em>.”’
Hence this new covenant between God and
Jesus was called ‘<em>the Covenant of Grace</em>.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I should like to hear more,” said Emma,
“about this glorious Being who loved man
so much as to die for him. Why is He called
by the name of <em>Redeemer</em>?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of the Person of the Redeemer.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Jesus is called ‘Redeemer,’
because He ‘buys
back’ the lost souls of men.
No one but God, in our nature, could do this.
If the highest angel in heaven had tried
to save us, he <em>could</em> not. Jesus Christ was
both God and man. He had lived from all
eternity ‘<em>with</em> God, and <em>was</em> God.’ He took
upon Him our nature, and was born a little
babe in the stable of Bethlehem. How sweet
for little children to think that Jesus was
once himself <em>a little child</em>!”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of the Humiliation of Christ.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “How wonderful!” said
Emma, “for the great God
of heaven to come down to
dwell with man on the earth—to be called the
‘Man of Sorrows’—to be poor and hated, and
have ‘nowhere to lay His head,’ till He laid
it on the Cross, and there died a cruel death!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Wonderful indeed,” replied her grandmamma.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“Can you tell me, my dear child,
what became of Jesus after He died?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of His Resurrection and Exaltation.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Yes,” answered Emma;
“I think He was laid in a
grave in the middle of a
garden in Jerusalem. A stone was put at
the mouth of it, and soldiers were made to
watch it. But after lying dead three days,
He rolled away the stone, and came forth
alive.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You are right, my child,” said Mrs Allan.
“By this, God the Father shewed that He had
accepted the work of His dear Son—that the
wages of sin were all paid, and that His holy
law was satisfied and honoured. After remaining
forty days on the earth, Jesus went up
among rejoicing angels to heaven.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And where is the Lord Jesus now?”
inquired Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of the Intercession of Christ.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “He who once was ‘despised
and rejected of men,’”
said her grandmother, “is
seated on a very glorious throne in the skies,
where blessed spirits without number adore
Him. But He has not forgotten poor sinners
on earth. He is engaged in praying to God
for them; and whatever He asks on their behalf,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>His Father is ready to give; for Him
He ‘heareth always.’”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of the Second Coming of Christ.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “And is there not a day
of awful glory drawing
near,” said Emma, “when
Jesus shall appear in the clouds of the sky,
seated on a ‘great white throne’? How dreadful
to be found, on that great day, on the left
hand of the Judge! Will there be no chance
of His being merciful to these miserable
wicked, and of making another ‘<em>covenant of
grace</em>’ with them?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No, no; impossible, my child!” replied
her grandmother. “God’s holiness, and
righteousness, and justice, and truth, could
not admit of mercy <em>then</em>. Jesus is now
seated on a throne of <em>Grace</em>, and entreats sinners
to come to Him and be saved. But
when once seated on His throne of <em>Judgment</em>,
the time of grace is at an end. Those who
there seek Him for the first time will never
find Him. God has said, ‘Then shall they
call on me, but I will not answer.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I should like you,” said Emma, “to tell
me what you mean by ‘seeking Jesus.’ I
fear I may never yet have sought Him in
earnest.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“I shall be happy, my dear child, to explain
this and many other things to you; but
as it would take me too long to‐night, I shall
wait till next Sabbath, when, if God spare me,
I will speak to you about some more of these
solemn truths. I am old, and must soon
stand before that great throne; but I have
long sought and found Jesus the <em>Saviour</em>,
and I am not afraid to meet Jesus the <em>Judge</em>!”</p>

<p class='c017'>The little child knelt down on her grandmother’s
lap, to offer up her evening prayer.
The aged Christian entreated earnestly that
Jesus would early give her an interest in His
“covenant of grace,” that she might be found
at last on His right hand, at the great day,
an heir of glory!</p>

<h3 id='second' class='c018'>SECOND NIGHT.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Sabbath evening again returned; and when
the shutters were closed, and fresh wood had
been piled on the fire, little Emma climbed on
her grandmamma’s knee, and asked her to
explain some more “Scripture doctrines.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall do so with pleasure, my child,”
said Mrs Allan; “and I must ask you to
give me to‐night your close attention, as I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>going to speak to you about some very important
and precious truths.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Emma thanked her for her great kindness,
in being at so much pains to instruct her;
and her grandmamma thus began:—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of Justification.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “You will remember, my
dear, that the Bible tells
us we are all condemned by nature—in a lost
and ruined state. In order to make us understand
what this state is, it represents,—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Judge.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “God as a great Judge,
‘of purer eyes than to behold
iniquity,’ and who cannot look upon sin.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Prisoner.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “It represents the sinner
as standing at His bar,
called to answer for his many thousand transgressions.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Witnesses.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “And, as in a court of
earthly justice witnesses
are brought in to condemn the prisoner, so
Satan accuses the sinner—his own heart
accuses him—God’s Law, which he has
broken, accuses him.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And what more?” said Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Sentence.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “These all,” said her
grandmother, “pronounce
the sinner ‘<em>guilty</em>’—the Holy Judge passes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>upon him a sentence of <em>condemnation</em>. Oh!
how dreadful to think, that, if ‘out of Christ,’
we are <em>at this moment</em> in a <em>condemned state</em>!
We have not to wait till a day of judgment
to have the sentence pronounced upon us.
The Bible tells us we are ‘condemned <em>already</em>,’
and that ‘the wrath of God <em>abideth</em> upon us.’
We are, as it were, shut up in a condemned
cell; the kindness and clemency of our Judge
alone delaying the execution of the awful
sentence!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But is there no hope,” said little Emma,
“for the poor sinner? Must he die in that
state of condemnation and misery?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>God’s Method of Mercy.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “No, dear child,” replied
her grandmamma. “God
is willing, for Christ’s sake,
to ‘<em>justify</em>’ us.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But what do you mean by that word?”
said Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Listen to me,” said the other, “and I
will endeavour to explain. I have already
told you that the sinner, standing in the
court‐room of justice, with the chains of condemnation
fastened round him, cannot answer
a word for himself; his ‘mouth is stopped,’
and he has become ‘guilty before God.’</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Advocate.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “But, in the midst of
that court‐room, there is
one who stands up to ‘answer’ <em>for</em> him!—it
is the ‘Advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“God the Judge asks, ‘Sinner! can you
say anything to justify yourself?’ The sinner
says, ‘Enter not into judgment with thy
servant, O God! for in Thy sight no flesh
living can be justified.’</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Grounds of Pardon.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “God is about to execute
the awful sentence; but
Jesus, his advocate, stands
up, and says, ‘<em>I</em> have suffered, “the Just for
the unjust;” I have obeyed the law the sinner
should have obeyed; I have been “made
sin for him;” I have paid with my own blood
the price of his redemption!’</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Acquittal.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “The Great Judge says,
‘It is enough! Take the
chains of condemnation off him. I pronounce
him, for the sake of what Jesus has done and
suffered, “<em>not guilty</em>!” Let him go out of the
court‐room a “justified man;” for “there is
no condemnation to them that are in Christ
Jesus.”’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Do you mean to say, grandmamma,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Emma, “that God thus graciously pardons
<em>all</em> the iniquities of the sinner for the sake of
Jesus?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Two parts of Justification.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1. Forgiveness of
Sin.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Yes, my child; it is an
amazing thought.  But,
on account of what the
Lord Jesus Christ has done,
in pouring out His precious
blood, this great and holy Judge looks upon
the sinner <em>as if he had never sinned at all</em>!
He is, in the eye of law, ‘<em>justified</em>’—considered
‘<em>just</em>.’ Jesus is said to be ‘wounded for his
transgressions, and bruised for his iniquities.’
Like the scape‐goat under the Jewish law, God
‘has laid upon Christ the iniquities of us all.’
These He has carried away into a land of forgetfulness,
where they can never more be
found!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“This is a wonderful doctrine indeed!”
said little Emma, “and”――</p>

<p class='c017'>“Stay, my child,” interrupted her grandmamma,
“I have not yet told you the most
wondrous part of it:—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>2. Acceptance as
Righteous in God’s
sight.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “In justifying sinners,
God does more than merely
<em>pardon</em> them. He not only
reckons the sinner as ‘<em>not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>guilty</em>,’ but, for Jesus’ sake, He counts him as
positively <em>righteous</em>. All the righteousness of
Christ—His obedience, and patience, and
love, and resignation, and forgiveness of
injuries, and all the holy things of His holy
life,—are put down to the sinner’s account;
and a holy God actually counts as if they
had all been done by the sinner himself.
This is what is called <em>Christ’s imputed righteousness</em>.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Surely,” said Emma, “this explains the
meaning of that verse I was reading to you
this morning in Isaiah—‘He hath clothed me
with the garments of salvation; He hath
covered me with a robe of righteousness’?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes; you are right, my dear. The holy
life, and virtues, and obedience of Jesus, are
spoken of as a bright shining robe or garment,
in which the poor sinner clothes himself. By
nature, in his condemned state, he is black
with sin; and his language is, ‘O Lord, look
not on me, because I am black;’ but when
he puts this imputed garment on, he can say,
‘O Lord, look upon me, for I am all bright
and shining with a Saviour’s righteousness!’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“How kind is God,” exclaimed Emma,
“to do all this for vile sinners!”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Justification all of Grace.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Yes, my child; well
may justification be called
‘an act of God’s <em>free grace</em>;’
for man has no part in it. He deserves
nothing at God’s hand but wrath, and vengeance,
and condemnation. He might have
been sent away trembling from His bar, crying
out, ‘It is a fearful thing to fall into the
hands of the living God!’ His justification
proceeds from free sovereign mercy; and
through all eternity his confession will be,
‘By the grace of God, I am what I am.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I fear I may be wearying you,” said
Emma; “but I have just one other question
to ask you about this glorious doctrine—how
can <em>I</em> be justified, and get the great God thus
to pardon and accept <span class='fss'>ME</span>?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Received by Faith.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “That is a very proper
question,” replied her grandmamma,
“and I am happy to think I can
give you a simple and easy answer. You
are justified ‘<em>by faith</em>;’ by <em>believing</em> that God
is able and willing to receive you—that Jesus
has shed His precious blood for you—that He
died for you on earth, and now lives and
pleads for you in heaven. ‘He that <em>believeth</em>
on the Son of God hath life.’  ‘<em>Believe</em> in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.’
‘Therefore being justified <em>by faith</em>, we have
peace with God.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“This glorious subject of Justification,”
continued she, “has occupied us so long, that
it will be better not to speak of any other
doctrine to‐night. If spared till another
Sabbath evening, I shall do so. I would
have you, my child, think very much about
this most precious Bible truth—<em>How a sinner
is justified before God</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Article of a
Standing and Falling
Church.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Luther, the great father
of the Reformation, said,
that a church could not
stand for a moment without
this doctrine. Like a house without a
foundation, it would fall to pieces. And an
older saint than Luther—the apostle Paul—had
his mind so full of it, that you cannot
read his writings, and understand them, without
keeping this blessed doctrine constantly
in view.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh how peaceful, and safe, and joyous,”
exclaimed Emma, “must the justified sinner
be!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, truly,” replied her grandmother.
“He has nothing to fear. On the great day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of judgment, however many his enemies and
accusers may be, he can look around him on
all of them, and exclaim, with the great
apostle, ‘Who shall lay anything to the
charge of God’s elect? It is <span class='sc'>God that
justifieth</span>; who is he that condemneth?’
Here is a beautiful verse of a hymn I should
like you to learn by heart,” she added, repeating
twice over to little Emma the following
lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Jesus! Thy blood and righteousness</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id='third' class='c018'>THIRD NIGHT.</h3>

<p class='c019'>“Are you ready now?” said little Emma,
coming skipping into her grandmother’s
room. “I have just finished learning my
verses in Romans, and I so weary to hear
about some more Scripture doctrines.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am quite ready,” said her grandmamma;
“but it would make me happy,
before I begin, to hear you repeat whatever
verses you have been committing to memory
to‐night.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>So saying, Emma stood by her grandmother’s
chair, and, without a mistake, repeated
from the 10th to the 15th verse
of the eighth chapter of Romans. The last
one was this, “Ye have not received the
spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have
received the spirit of adoption, whereby we
cry, Abba, Father!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am happy, my dear child,” said old
Mrs Allan, “that these have been your
verses to‐night, as they refer to the very
subject I should like now to speak to you
about.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You remember what I explained to you
last Sabbath?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, grandmamma,” said Emma. “It
was about <em>Justification</em>. God the Great Judge
trying the sinner at His bar, and sending
him away freely forgiven for the sake of
Christ.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of Adoption.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “You are right, my
dear; and we are now
going to speak about <em>Adoption</em>.  I wonder
if you know what that is.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, no. I have often wondered what
that word can mean, and I long to hear from
you.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Difference between
Justification and
Adoption.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Well, then, my child,
as in Justification God acts
as a <em>Judge</em>, so in Adoption
God acts as a <em>Father</em>.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“How I should like to hear about this,
grandmamma! There is something terrible
about the thought of a <em>Judge</em>; but there is
nothing but love and joy in the thought of a
<em>Father</em>!”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of our State by Nature.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “It is true, my dear,”
said her grandmother; “but
by nature none of us are in
the family of God; we are called ‘children of
wrath;’ ‘children of the devil;’ ‘enemies!’
God puts a very solemn and striking question
about us—‘How shall I set thee among the
children?’ He sees that we are such poor
miserable sinners, that if He had dealt with
us as we have deserved for our sins, we should
have been for ever ‘children of wrath!’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What, then, could have made God adopt
us into His family?” said little Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Difference between
Man’s Adoption
and God’s.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “This, my child,” replied
the other, “is the thing in
which <em>God’s</em> Adoption differs
from <em>man’s</em>. When a
man takes a little orphan child into his house,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and is kind to it, and brings it up as his own,
it is because of something attractive, and
lovely, and engaging in the child. I knew an
old gentleman who saw a lovely little boy with
golden locks, and he was so struck with his
beauty, he would never part with him, but
brought him up as his own son. But how
different is it with us and God! The
Bible represents sinners as lying all filthy and
vile in the open field; so vile, that none would
look at them, ‘all passed them by!’ But
God came, lifted them up, and said unto them,
‘Live!’ ‘<em>I</em> will be a Father unto you, and ye
shall be my sons and daughters.’ What, my
dear Emma, would you call this act of God in
Adoption?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Adoption all of Grace.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Oh, I would say,” said
her little hearer, “that it
is the same as with Justification.
It is an ‘<em>act of God’s free grace</em>’—that
is to say, that there was nothing about
us to make God love us, or be kind to us, and
that it was all of His own great and wonderful
kindness and mercy in Christ Jesus!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You are right, my darling; and do you
remember the name of an aged disciple of
Jesus who delighted more than all the rest to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>speak of God’s love? And perhaps you remember,
too, what he says about this adopting
love of God?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, yes,” said Emma; “I think that
will be the text Mr R. was preaching from
last month:—‘Behold what manner of love
the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we
should be called the sons of God!’ But, dear
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>When Adoption takes place.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> grandmamma,” continued
she, “you told me last
Sabbath that Justification
takes place <em>in this world</em>, whenever the sinner
believes in Jesus. It cannot surely be that
this great honour of being children of God,
and adopted into His family, can begin on
earth?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, dear child, it does,” said her grandmother.
“Justification and Adoption are just
different names for one great act. God, as I
said, is represented in the one as a <em>Judge</em>, in
the other as a <em>Father</em>. I don’t know if Mr R.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Apostle John’s Testimony.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> took the next verse in that
beautiful chapter along with
his text. If he did so, it
will tell you <em>when</em> the believer is adopted, and
can call God his Father.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Little Emma quickly turned up her Bible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>and read as follows:—“Beloved, now are we
the sons of God!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You see, my child,” continued the old
lady, “<em>when</em> this act of fatherly love takes
place; it is ‘<em>now</em>;’ and if my dear little
Emma loves the Lord Jesus, she can <em>now</em>
look up to the Great God, and say, ‘He is my
<em>Father</em>;’ and to Jesus, and say, ‘He is my
<em>Elder Brother</em>!’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“How kind in God,” said Emma, with the
tear in her eye, “to love sinners so much,
and deal with them so tenderly! I think
this, too, explains my favourite story in the
gospel—does it not, grandmamma?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Our Lord’s Parable about Adoption.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “I remember now what
your favourite is,” said the
other, after thinking a
moment; “it is the <em>Prodigal Son</em>; and you
are very right; there is no portion of the
Bible which speaks more beautifully of God’s
adopting love. You remember, at the very
same moment that God forgave the Prodigal,
He ordered ‘the ring to be put on his finger’
(the ring of <em>adoption</em>); and He calls him,
‘<em>This, my son!</em>’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! I shall love to read that parable
more than ever,” said Emma. “I don’t think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>any earthly father would have been so kind
to an ungrateful son. But you often tell me
that ‘God’s ways are not as man’s ways;’
and it is surely so in this.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Evidences of Adoption.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “But how can I know,
dear grandmamma, whether
<em>I</em> am a child of God? I
would feel as if I was richer and happier
than the richest in the world, and greater
than earthly kings or queens, if I could be
sure that the Great God was my Father, and
that I was His child.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That is a very natural question, my dear,
and I shall do what I can to answer you.
Let me ask you another question. What are
your feelings towards your earthly parents?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Love of God.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “I love them,” said
Emma, “very much; I try
to do what they bid me, and I am always
unhappy when I do anything that vexes or
hurts them.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hatred of Sin.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “It is the very same, my
dear,” said her grandmother,
“with the children of God. If you
are really a child of God, you will love Him,
and try to do all His will, and be unhappy whenever
you sin against Him or displease Him.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“I will tell you another thing, grandmamma,”
interrupted the little girl; “I am
never happy when I am far away from
my father, or when my father is far away
from me. Sometimes he has to go away for
many days to a distance, and I so weary for
his coming back. I think and speak of him
all the day long; and once I remember, when
I was a week away at aunt Fanny’s, I so
longed to get back again to be with
him.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Filial Nearness.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Well, dear child, you
have just given another
mark by which you may know if you are a
child of God. Do you love your Heavenly
Father’s presence? Do you love prayer,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Prayer.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> which brings you always
near Him? and are you
always unhappy when you forget prayer,
which drives you away from God; or commit
sin, which drives God away from you?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, yes, dear grandmamma, I think I
can say I am; but then, I often sin, and I
fear”――</p>

<p class='c017'>“Stop, my dear child,” said the old lady.
“Remember, it is a great cause of grief to
the true child of God, that the power of sin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>is so strong in his heart, and that the devil is
so often tempting him.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But,” exclaimed Emma, “does not the
Bible say, ‘We <em>cannot</em> sin, because we are
born of God’?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How the Child of God “cannot sin.”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Yes, my child, you are
correct; but I must tell
you the real meaning of
that verse, so that you may not be cast down
by supposing it asks what you cannot give.
That verse means, that God’s children cannot
go on in a <em>course</em> of sin. They cannot love
sin, and continue <em>in</em> sin; but it does not mean
that their lives are so perfectly holy that
they never can know what it is to have a
bad heart and wicked thought. Alas! this
never can be, till the adopted children of God
get safe into their Father’s house in
heaven!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! how I wish,” said Emma, “I could
love this kind Heavenly Father more than I
have ever yet done; and hate sin more and
more every day!――I am afraid, dear grandmamma,
I tire you with my questions; but
I have just one more to ask to‐night, and
then I shall go to bed. You often speak of
it being our duty to ‘<em>fear</em> God.’ Now, how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>should we <em>fear</em> a God that you have just been
telling me to <em>love</em>?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>What it is to “fear” God in Adoption.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “I do not wonder, my
child, at your question.
But there are two kinds of
fear; the wicked ‘<em>fear</em>’ God as an awful
Judge; they fear Him—that is, they are
<em>afraid</em> of Him, and tremble to think of His
hatred of sin, and His judgment day. But
the children of God ‘<em>fear</em>’ their Heavenly
Father in another sense; they ‘<em>fear</em>’ to <em>offend</em>
Him. It is because they <em>love</em> Him so very
much, that they are <em>afraid</em> of doing anything
that would displease Him. The wicked
man’s fear is what the Bible calls ‘the fear
that hath torment.’ The other is the fear,
and reverence, and godly awe of ‘perfect
love.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“Good‐night, then, my dear,” said the
kind old lady, kissing her little scholar. “I
love you much as an earthly parent; but
your Heavenly Father loves you more.
When you go down on your knees to pray
to Him to‐night, think of that sweet verse
in <abbr title='Jeremiah'>Jer.</abbr> <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 4, ‘<em>My Father!</em> thou art the guide
of my youth!’</p>

<p class='c017'>“You will not know all the wonders of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>subject I have been speaking about to‐night
till the gracious Heavenly Father who adopts
you opens to you the gates of His own
palace in glory, and when, taking you by the
hand, and shewing you all the unsearchable
riches which Jesus has purchased for you,
He will say, ‘My child! <em>thou art ever with
me; and all that I have</em> IS THINE!’”</p>

<h3 id='fourth' class='c018'>FOURTH NIGHT.</h3>

<p class='c019'>“I fear I weary you, grandmamma,” said
little Emma, as she opened the room‐door on
the following Sabbath, and resumed her accustomed
seat by the good old lady’s side—“I
fear I weary you, coming so often to hear
your nice explanations of Bible doctrines; but
you have already enabled me to understand a
great deal I never knew before, and have
made my Sabbath evenings so happy!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I assure you, you have made me happy
too, my dear child,” said Mrs Allan, wiping
the tear that was rolling down her withered
cheek. “I can truly say, I have no greater
joy than to talk to you about these glorious
truths. I will soon be in that silent place,”
continued she, pointing, as she was closing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>her shutters for the night, to the churchyard,
on which the moon was then shining; “but
it makes me happy to think, that when you
can hear my voice no more, you will remember,
with joy, the Sabbath evenings we have
spent together. Happy, dear Emma, will it
be,” her face brightening as she spoke, “if we
meet to speak of these blessed truths in the
better Sabbath in heaven!”</p>

<p class='c017'>Emma was about to reply, when her grandmother
took her by the hand, and said, with
a kindly smile, “Well, dearest, and what
would you have me talk to you about to‐night?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You are the proper judge,” replied her
little scholar, “as to what will best follow
after the two beautiful doctrines you have
last explained to me, of <em>Justification</em> and
<em>Adoption</em>. The other day I came to a difficult
word in a book, which,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of Regeneration.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> if it would not be out of
place, I should like to know something about.
The word was <em>Regeneration</em>, and”――</p>

<p class='c017'>“Stay, my dear,” interrupted her grandmother;
“that is the very subject I was
thinking of. You could not have named a
better; and if you will give me all your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>attention, I shall try to open up this great
doctrine to you as simply as I can.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Do you remember what I told you about
<em>Justification</em>?—What God does to the sinner
when He justifies and adopts him?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Difference between Justification,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “He changes his <em>state</em>,”
replied Emma. “He brings
him from a <em>state</em> of <em>wrath</em> to
a <em>state</em> of <em>grace</em>,—from a <em>state</em> of <em>condemnation</em>
to a <em>state</em> of <em>pardon</em>.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You have given me just the answer I
wanted,” said her grandmother—“that it is a
change of <em>state</em> or <em>condition</em>. In Justification,
from being a <em>rebel</em>, the sinner is pardoned by
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Adoption,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> his Sovereign. In Adoption,
from being a <em>prodigal</em>,
he is received back into his Father’s lost
home. Now, dear,” continued she, “did I
say that in these there is produced also any
change in <em>character</em>?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t think so,” replied Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You are right; and you will instantly
see how well it is that I should speak to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>And Regeneration.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> you about Regeneration to‐night,
which is the very
word which tells about this great change of
<em>character</em> or <em>mind</em>, which is as necessary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>salvation, as the great change of <em>state</em> and
<em>condition</em> of which I have already spoken.
What is your own idea, my dear child, as to
the meaning of Regeneration?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Indeed, grandmamma,” replied Emma,
“it is such a long and difficult word, that I
am ashamed to tell, though I have often
heard it mentioned in Mr R――’s sermon, I
never understood it aright.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You should never be ashamed, my dear,
to ask those older than yourself to explain
Bible difficulties to you. Many grow up to
be big people, in great ignorance, owing to
this false shame.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Is it the same, grandmamma,” said
Emma, “as <em>Repentance</em>? I think I understand
<em>that</em> word better.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bible Terms about Regeneration.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Yes, my child, there are many words in
the Bible used to denote this same great
change, and which you
must often hear ministers
speaking about. ‘The <em>new
birth</em>’—being ‘<em>born again</em>’—‘<em>Conversion</em>’—‘<em>Repentance</em>’—‘<em>Regeneration</em>;’
but the meaning
of them all may be summed up in
this,—the necessity of a new heart, produced
by the Holy Spirit, who turns the old heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>from the service of sin to the service of
God.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Necessity of Regeneration.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “But must every one
have this entire change of
heart before he can be
saved?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, dearest, it is a doctrine many don’t
like to believe, or to hear about, because they
think it makes the way to heaven too strait
and narrow; but do you remember anything
Jesus said about it, when He was speaking
to inquiring Nicodemus?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>What Jesus says of it.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Oh, yes,” said Emma,
“you have put me in mind
of the verse now—‘Except
a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
of God.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You are quite correct,” replied the old
lady. “That same blessed Saviour never
spoke an unkind word, and He would never
have uttered this, unless it was a solemn
truth, ‘Marvel not that I said unto you,
Ye <em>must</em> be <em>born again</em>.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But if the sinner,” asked Emma, “is
justified in the sight of God, and God calls
him ‘<em>not guilty</em>,’ and <em>pardons</em> him, and
says of him there is <em>no condemnation</em>, what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>more does he require, in order to be
saved?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Change of State
and a Change of
Heart must go
together.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “A great deal more,”
replied her grandmother.
“Let me ask you,” said
she to Emma, “two questions,
which may help to explain the matter
to you. If a king pardoned a rebel, and if
that rebel still hated his sovereign, and sought
to kill him, would it be safe for the king to
receive the ungrateful rebel into his palace?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No!” replied Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Or, if a father received back a prodigal
son; but if that son <em>continued</em> prodigal as
ever, breaking, with fresh sin, his poor old
father’s heart, and corrupting his other brothers,
could that father permit him to live in his
house?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No, <em>surely</em>,” still replied Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, dearest, what would require to be
done to make it safe for the king to keep
company with the rebel he had pardoned;
and the father to take the son to live with
him in his own household?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“If they had changed and better hearts,”
said Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You have just given again the answer I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>wanted,” said her grandmother. “I want
you to see it is the same with the sinner.
God the <em>King</em> has pardoned the <em>sinner‐rebel</em>.
God the <em>Father</em> has adopted the <em>sinner‐prodigal</em>;
but He never could receive him into His
glorious palace of heaven, unless what?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Change of Heart in
Regeneration needed
for Heaven.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Oh, unless his heart is
<em>changed</em>,” exclaimed Emma.
“I understand it now. He
must have a <em>holy</em> heart,—a
heart to love God and hate sin. I see quite
well he could not get into heaven with an unchanged
heart!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, my dear child,” said the other
(happy that her little grand‐daughter was now
able to see the meaning of Regeneration);
“and even if the sinner could get into heaven
with his sinful, unchanged, unconverted heart,
could he be happy?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Heaven a place for holy Hearts.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “I don’t think,” said
Emma, “he could; he
would be miserable in that
holy place, amid holy angels and a holy God.
I see quite well now the truth of what Jesus
says, ‘Except ye be converted, ye cannot
enter in the kingdom of heaven.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“But,” continued little Emma, getting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>more interested in the subject, “I should like
much to know <em>how</em>, and <em>when</em>, and <em>where</em> we
are regenerated, and get this new mind.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Agent in Regeneration.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Like every other thing
in salvation,” replied the
old lady, “this great change
of heart and life is the work of God; and
though all the glorious Trinity are engaged
in producing it, it is more especially brought
about by the agency of the third person in
the blessed Godhead—the Holy Ghost.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But how do you know when it takes
place?” continued Emma. “Are we aware
of the time when the Holy Spirit works this
great change?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Method of Regeneration.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “No,” replied her grandmother. “You
remember how simply and beautifully Jesus
speaks of this to one who was asking about
it, and wondering about it, like <em>you</em>. That,
just as you cannot tell
where the wind comes from—you
hear it blowing, but
cannot tell <em>from where</em>—‘so is every one that
is born of the Spirit.’ That new birth, or
change, is wrought silently in the soul. It is
like the little dew‐drops that sparkle in the
morning sun, which gather unseen and unnoticed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>during the night; or like the Temple
of Jerusalem of old, which was built without
any noise of ‘hammer, or axe, or any tool of
iron;’—it rose without din or observation;
and this is the case with every renewed heart
when it becomes a ‘temple of the Holy
Ghost.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then it takes a long time, grandmamma,
before a sinner’s heart can be changed?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Various Modes of Operation.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “The Spirit of God, my
child, acts <em>how</em>, and <em>where</em>,
and <em>when</em> He pleases. He
sometimes converts and renews, <em>in a moment</em>,
as He did the thief on the cross and the
jailer of Philippi, or the thousands at
Pentecost. Sometimes He does it <em>gradually</em>
(or by <em>degrees</em>), as in the case of Nicodemus;
and sometimes, as I trust, my dear Emma, is
the case with you, He sanctifies from infancy,
changes the young heart, as He did in the
case of Timothy, and Samuel, and Jeremiah.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Am I Regenerated?<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Oh! I am happy to hear you say so,”
replied Emma, “for I was beginning to fear
that I had never felt the Holy Spirit <em>changing
my heart</em>, and that I must
surely be yet unregenerated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and unsaved. Such a thought would be very
awful to me.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I trust, my dear child,” said her grandmother,
“I have good reason to believe that
God, by His grace and Spirit, has ‘turned
you from darkness to light,’ and given you a
heart to love Him and serve Him. I wish
that many little children would have such a
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Awful Importance of Regeneration.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <em>fear</em> as you speak of. I
wish many, too, would remember
that one little word
MUST, and <em>who</em> says it, ‘Ye <em>MUST</em> be born
again!’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dear grandmamma,” said Emma, “I
must pray more than I ever have done for a
<em>clean heart</em>. I fear, till you have been explaining
this to me, I have thought too much
about my sins being washed in Jesus’ blood,
and too little about my heart being changed
and made holy by Jesus’ Spirit. I see that
I need both, and will try and pray for both.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is a good resolution, my dearest,” said
the other; “and the Great God, for your encouragement
in asking for a change of heart,
gives you in His own
blessed Bible both a <em>prayer</em>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Prayer for it, and its Answer.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and an <em>answer</em>. Give me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>your Bible,” continued she, “and, as I feel
unable to speak more to‐night, I will mark
the two places to which I refer, and you can
take them with you to your own room, and
read them to yourself.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The good old lady kissed her little grandchild,
putting two pieces of paper at what
she had so marked. Emma, saying “Good‐night,”
ran up‐stairs with her Bible in her
hand, and, having shut her door, read to herself,
before she knelt down to her evening
prayer, these two verses:—</p>

<p class='c017'><em>The Prayer.</em>—“Create in me a clean heart,
O God; renew a right spirit within me” (<abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr>
<abbr title='51'>li.</abbr> 10).</p>

<p class='c017'><em>The Answer.</em>—“A new heart also will I
give you, and a right spirit will I put within
you; and I will take away the stony heart out
of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of
flesh” (<abbr title='Ezekiel'>Ezek.</abbr> <abbr title='36'>xxxvi.</abbr> 26).</p>

<h3 id='fifth' class='c018'>FIFTH NIGHT.</h3>

<p class='c019'>“I am now ready for you,” said old Mrs
Allan, as little Emma was waiting anxiously
for the time when she might again seat herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>by her grandmother’s chair. “What am
I to tell you about to‐night?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have been thinking,” replied Emma,
“if you have no more to explain about the
great work in the soul of the believer, that I
should like to hear more of that glorious
Being to whom the sinner owes all the precious
blessings you have been telling me of.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of the Person,
Offices, and Work
of Christ.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “I shall gladly do so,
my dear child. It is a delightful
subject to converse
upon the Person, Offices,
and Work of the Lord Jesus Christ, who,
though He was rich, yet for our sakes He
became poor.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall hear attentively,” said Emma,
“what you have to say, as there is much
about the <em>Person</em> of Jesus I do not rightly
understand. He is called
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Christ the Son of
God and Son of
Man.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> both ‘Son of God’ and
‘Son of Man.’ I often
wonder how this can be.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“This, my child,” replied her grandmother,
“is the great mystery of godliness, ‘God
manifest in the flesh,’—but it is a glorious
mystery; and happy shall I be to speak to
you upon it.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Son of God.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “The Lord Jesus Christ
is the eternal Son of God.
He was ‘with God, and was God.’ Before
this world, or any worlds were made, He
dwelt from everlasting with the Father.  He
is equal with Him in power and in glory. If
He had been an angel, or an archangel, He
could not have saved us, for the highest
archangel is only a <em>creature</em>—and one created
being cannot atone for the sin of another.
In one word, if Jesus had not been <em>God</em>, He
could not have been the Saviour of man.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Son of Man.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “But is he not spoken
of,” said Emma, “also as
the Son of Man?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, my dear; and I must add, if He had
not been man, He could not have saved us.
As our surety, it was necessary for Him to
suffer and die in the nature which had sinned—and
besides, you know, that <em>as God</em>, He
could not have suffered, because the Divine
nature is a spiritual one. Therefore it is
that He says, ‘A <em>body</em> hast thou prepared
Me.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I think, too,” said Emma, “it is a blessed
thought that our great Redeemer was a man.
If He had been God only, He could not have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>felt for us in the way He can do as the ‘Son
of Man.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You are right, my dear child. This is
one of the most delightful thoughts about the
person of Jesus, that He is our ‘elder brother,’
and not ashamed to call us ‘brethren.’ He
can say to all of us, ‘I know your sorrows,’
for He was Himself ‘the Man of Sorrows,’
and felt them all.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Titles of Jesus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Would you explain to
me,” said the young inquirer,
“the meaning of some more of the
names of the Lord Jesus Christ?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Immanuel.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “He is called,” said her grandmamma, “by
that beautiful word, which
tells that He is both God
and man, ‘<em>Immanuel</em>,’ which means, ‘God
with us.’</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Jesus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Then He is called
‘<em>Jesus</em>,’ because He ‘saves’
His people—the word Jesus meaning ‘Saviour.’</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Messiah, Christ.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Then He is called
‘<em>Messiah</em>,’ and ‘<em>Christ</em>,’ because
He is the anointed of God—both
words meaning ‘anointed.’ As kings, in
ancient times, had anointing oil poured upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>their heads when they were set apart to their
royal office, so our blessed Saviour had the
anointing oil of the Holy Spirit poured upon
Him, to qualify Him for His offices as mediator.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“The <em>Offices</em> of Jesus; dear grandmamma,
I have often heard these spoken of. Will
you kindly explain to me what they mean?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Offices of Christ.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “The Lord Jesus Christ,
my dear child, stands in
different relations, and performs
different acts with regard to the Church
He has redeemed with His precious blood. I
shall mention to you the three under which
He is most frequently referred to.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Prophet.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Jesus is the <em>Prophet</em> of
His Church. He is her
great Teacher. By means of His precious
Word, and the influences of His Spirit, He
makes known to us His own will, and the
will of God for our salvation.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Priest.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Jesus is the <em>Priest</em> of
His Church. A priest,
you know, in former times, offered sacrifices
on the altar. Jesus is called the ‘Great
High Priest of our profession.’ He was Himself
both the Priest and the Victim, for ‘He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>gave Himself for us;’ and just as the Jewish
high priest of old went into the holy of holies
and sprinkled on the mercy‐seat the blood of
the slain sacrifice, and prayed to God for the
people, so Jesus has carried the merits of His
own blood into heaven, and, as <em>our</em> High
Priest, is there pleading our cause at God’s
right hand. You remember, too, the high
priest of old, after being within the vail,
came out to bless the waiting people. So
Jesus, our Great High Priest, will, at His
second coming in glory, bless His assembled
Church, saying, ‘Come, ye blessed of my
Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world.’</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>King.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Jesus also is <em>King</em> of
His Church, the ruler <em>in</em> it,
and ruler <em>over</em> it. He protects it from its
enemies; and though often, like the bush
which Moses saw in the wilderness, it burns
with fire, He will prevent it from ever being
consumed. He will continue to reign over it
as King, until all enemies be put under His
feet.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What a wonderful and complete Saviour,
grandmamma!” exclaimed Emma. “Jesus
is so great, and yet so compassionate! I feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>as if I can adore Him as God, and yet love
Him as a brother.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“True, most true, my dear child; He is all
you need—the very Saviour you <em>do</em> need. It
is a wonderful thought, His Godhead and
His Manhood! As God, angels and seraphs
worshipped Him. As Man, little children
smiled in His arms!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I love to think of Him, too,” said Emma,
“as my High Priest in heaven.  It does
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Christ’s Intercessory Work.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> not make me afraid to
approach the Great God,
when I have so kind a
Saviour to intercede for me.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You are right, my dear,” said the other;
“there is no thought more pleasing and
delightful, than that we have in glory ‘a
Prince’ that has ‘power with God,’ and must
‘prevail.’ The Apostle Paul rejoiced much
in this truth. It gave him ‘boldness,’ as he
calls it, to approach the throne of grace.
And the Apostle John, in his vision <a id='tn047'></a>on the
Isle of Patmos, beheld Jesus as the Angel of
the Covenant, with a ‘censer’ in His hand.
His people on earth put all their prayers into
this censer, and a fragrant cloud ascends from
it before the throne.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“What is the meaning of that?” asked
Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It tells us, my child,” said her grandmother,
“that the believer’s poor, imperfect
prayers, when sprinkled and made fragrant
with the incense of Christ’s adorable merits,
ascend with acceptance into the ear of God
Himself. God hears the poorest and unworthiest
of His saints, for the sake of the
work and merits of Jesus.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I can now well understand,” said Emma,
“how the Apostle Paul could say with such
a grateful heart, ‘Thanks be to God for His
unspeakable gift!’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes,” replied the other, “it <em>is</em> unspeakable—and
the more you know of Jesus, the
more wonders will you discover in His
person, and the more glories in His work.
Oh! seek to love him more and more every
day. Let it be your constant wish, and
desire, and prayer—how can I do enough
for this Saviour who has done so much, so
very much for me?</p>

<p class='c017'>“But I can say no more to‐night. May
this blessed Saviour, my dear child, be yours—yours
now, and yours for ever!”</p>

  <h3 id='sixth' class='c018'>SIXTH NIGHT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>“It is a long time,” said Emma, running to
her grandmother’s side, “since you were last
able to tell me those nice things about Bible
doctrines. I have been longing much for
you to be able to speak to me again about
them.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I feel better and stronger now,” said old
Mrs Allan, who had been for many weeks
laid aside, “and I am as happy as my little
Emma can be, to find myself once more in
my old oaken chair, with her at my knee.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thank you, grandmamma,” said she,
clinging affectionately to her withered hand;
“and what are you going to speak to me
about to‐night?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Our last conversation, my child, if I remember
well, was on the intercessory work of
the Lord Jesus. I think you would like to
hear me speak of the final great act of His
mediatorial reign, when He will come at the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Resurrection
and Judgment.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> resurrection to judge the
world.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, yes!” said Emma;
“I should like much to hear of that awfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>glorious day. I often tremble when I think
about it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It has no terrors, my child, to God’s own
people. It is to them a very joyful day—the
happiest of all their lives; for then they shall be
brought to the full enjoyment of God for ever.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Souls of Believers at Death.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “But, dear grandmamma,
I thought, when believers
die, they go to heaven
at the very moment of death; that the
angels of God are waiting by their pillows to
carry them into Jesus’ bosom.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“True—most true, my child,” replied
the aged lady; “the moment the saint
closes his eyes on this world, he opens them in
heaven. The souls of believers are at their
death made perfect in holiness, and do immediately
pass into glory. You perhaps remember
some of the things the Apostle Paul
said in the prospect of death?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes,” said Emma; “‘Having a desire to
depart, and to be with Christ, which is far
better;’ ‘Willing rather to be absent from the
body, and to be present with the Lord.’ I remember,
too, of Stephen, when his wicked murderers
were stoning him, how he cried out,
‘Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.’”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“Quite right, my dear; and that other
saying of the Saviour to the poor thief on the
cross is more to the point still, when He said
to him, ‘Verily I say unto thee, <em>To‐day</em> shalt
thou be with me in paradise.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But then, from all these verses,” said
Emma, “is not heaven begun at the hour of
death?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is, my child,” replied her grandmother.
“I have already told you that, at the moment
of death, the soul of the saint is made perfectly
holy, and happy too, beyond what we
can now conceive; but its state of final and
complete glorification will not take place until
the day of judgment.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What is it,” said the little inquirer,
“which will then add to its state of glory and
blessedness?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Bodies of Believers.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “You know, my dear,”
was the reply, “that the
<em>body</em> of the believer is not
taken to heaven at the hour of death. It is
laid in the tomb. You remember too well
that sad day when your little brother was
laid in his grave in the churchyard. His
happy spirit, I believe, is now in heaven, joyful
in the presence and love of God; but his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>full state of glory and blessedness will not be
complete until his body is raised again on the
resurrection morning. Perhaps I should tell
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Purchased by
Christ.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> you that the body, as well
as the soul, is part of the
purchase of the Lord Jesus
Christ. Every particle of the saints’ dust is
redeemed by His blood. The Apostle speaks
of  ‘our <em>bodies</em> and our spirits’ as ‘not our
own,’ but ‘bought with a price.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But how can this be?” inquired Emma;
“do you mean that the bodies of those who
have been buried for ages will come all to life
again, and the soul be once more united to
these?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Raised from the Grave.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Yes, my dear, it is indeed
a wonderful thought.
But what cannot the power
of God do? He has <em>said</em> that He will raise
us up at the last day. Do you remember
any of the words of Jesus about this?”</p>

<p class='c017'>Emma thought a little, and at last turned
up her Bible to the verses, and read them:
“Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming
in the which all that are in the graves
shall hear His voice, and shall come forth;
they that have done good, unto the resurrection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>of life; and they that have done evil,
unto the resurrection of damnation.” “But
how,” continued she, when she had finished,
and once more repeating her question of surprise—“how,
grandmamma, can this be?—does
not the dead body crumble into dust?
How can the particles that have for hundreds
and thousands of years been mixed with the
earth come together again?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“God can do anything, I answer once
more,” was the reply of the other. “We
should always remember that what is impossible
with man, is possible with God. We
are not without examples, my child, in the
natural world, of the wondrous changes which
the power of God can produce in smaller
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Doctrine of
the Resurrection
probable from
Analogy.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> things; and this shews us
(from what is called <em>analogy</em>)
that we have no
right to question the doctrine
I am now speaking about, however
strange and apparently impossible it may
seem to be.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What instances, grandmamma,” said
Emma, “may I ask, do you refer to in the
outer world? I should like to understand
better what you mean.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“I like to hear you asking for more information,
dear Emma, and I shall try to give it to
you. Well, then, I know you have often seen
the bright and beautiful butterfly with its
golden wings and rings of silver. Can you
believe that that lovely insect was once a
little grub or caterpillar? I see you are
astonished, my dear, at what I now say; but
it is the case. During winter, these little
worms lie in what is called a <em>chrysalis</em> state.
During this time there is nothing in the least
beautiful about them—I would say rather
the reverse; but all at once, when the
summer sun shines out, the little insect
bursts its coating, and is changed into a
lovely butterfly or moth, with expanded
wings, flying up into the blue sky, or
ranging at large amid the garden flowers.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh how wonderful is this!” exclaimed
Emma; “and I see now, grandmamma, what
you mean. This little creature teaches me to
understand how the same mighty power of
God, that changes the caterpillar into a butterfly,
can bring about the still more wonderful
change in raising our vile bodies from the
grave.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You are right, my child,” said her grandmother.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“I am glad you have understood
me; and if I had time, I might give you other
instances of a similar kind. You have seen,
for example, the farmer put the little grains of
seed into the ground; could you ever have
expected that the small pickles thrown into
the earth would spring up into the rich fields
of yellow corn you have seen waving at
harvest time?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh no,” replied Emma; “I have often
thought how curious this is, and also that the
little annual seed I sow in my own garden‐plot
should spring up such lovely flowers. The
seed looks so small and withered like, and
the flowers are so beautiful in colour, and
have such a sweet smell.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, my dear, does not God give us
proofs in these smaller things of what He can
do in greater things. The body laid in the
grave is like the seed laid in the ground, ‘it
is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory.’ I
should like you,” continued the old lady, “to
take your Bible and read all that striking
and beautiful passage of the Apostle Paul on
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Testimony of
St Paul.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> this subject.” Emma immediately
opened to the
15th chapter of 1st Corinthians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>42d verse, and read aloud as follows:—“It
is sown in corruption, it is raised in
incorruption: it is sown in dishonour, it is
raised in glory: it is sown in weakness, it is
raised in power: it is sown a natural body, it
is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural
body, and there is a spiritual body.... Behold,
I shew you a mystery; we shall not all
sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the
last trump (for the trumpet shall sound); and
the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we
shall be changed. For this corruptible must
put on incorruption, and this mortal must put
on immortality. So when this corruptible
shall have put on incorruption, and this
mortal shall have put on immortality, then
shall be brought to pass the saying that is
written, Death is swallowed up in victory.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What a wonderful scene that will be!”
said Emma, as she closed her Bible. “Dear
grandmamma, can you tell me <em>when</em> it will
take place?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>When the Resurrection will be.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “No, my child,” replied
she; “the Bible tells us
that ‘Of that day and hour knoweth no
man; no, not even the angels that are in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>heaven.’ God seems purposely to keep us in
the dark about the time of the coming of
Jesus, that we may be always ready for it.
It matters little how long or how short it may
be, provided we are now living as we would
wish we had done when we hear the trumpet
sounding.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And what sort of bodies,” said Emma,
“will they be that will then rise from the
graves?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“All that I can tell you,” replied her
grandmother, “is, that they will be glorious
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Glory of the Resurrection
Body.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> bodies, fashioned like
unto Christ’s glorified body.
They will be no more subject
to decay, and weakness, and disease, and
death. It is said of them, ‘They shall be
like Him’ (like Jesus), and also, ‘Neither
shall they die any more.’ And surely no
blessedness can be greater than this—to be
<em>like Jesus</em>, and <em>never</em> to <em>die</em>.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, grandmamma!” exclaimed Emma, “I
feel as if I would not be afraid to go to the
grave, after all that you have been now telling
me.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“True, my child, the lowliest grave in
yonder churchyard, if it be the grave of a true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>believer, is holy ground. Perhaps angels are
watching over it, and Jesus himself counts its
dust <em>precious</em>. The grave of the wicked is a
prison house, where they are detained in captivity
until the day of awful vengeance; but
the grave of the saint is a casket holding a
precious jewel. It is a bed of rest, where he
gently and peacefully ‘sleeps’ till awakened
on the happy morning of immortality.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But I must here, my dear, pause for to‐night.
We have been speaking so much
about this wondrous doctrine of the body’s
resurrection as to render it necessary that I
should wait till another Sabbath to speak as
I promised about the day of judgment.”</p>

<h3 id='seventh' class='c018'>SEVENTH NIGHT.</h3>

<p class='c019'>“You promised, grandmamma,” said little
Emma, as she found herself once more seated
by the old oaken chair, “to tell me to‐night
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Last Judgment.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
about the Day of Judgment.
I long to hear you
speak about so solemn a
subject. There is much about it I do not
understand.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It <em>is</em>, my child,” replied the other, “a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>solemn subject. It will be a dreadful day to
the wicked; but it will be a happy day to all
God’s dear children—the happiest day in
their lives.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Tell me, then, dear grandmamma, all that
the Bible tells us about it. I shall promise
to listen with great attention.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>What it is.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “The Judgment,” answered
the other, “is that
great transaction which is to take place at
the end of the world, when every man, and
woman, and child, that ever lived, will be
brought to trial before God’s ‘great white
throne.’ A trumpet will sound over their
graves. As I told you last Sabbath, the
mouldering dust will come to life again, and
the dead, small and great, will stand before
God.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What a wonderful and awful thought!”
exclaimed Emma; “but do you mean to say
that <em>all</em> will be there, without any exception?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“All!—all!” replied the aged lady, “from
Adam to the last inhabitant of the world.
There will be those who lived <em>before</em> the flood,
and <em>since</em> the flood. Patriarchs, and Prophets,
and Apostles—Jews and Gentiles—Pagans
and Christians—rich and poor—young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>and old—learned and unlearned—kings
and beggars—not one will be wanting;
and more still, <em>you</em> and <em>I</em> will be there. <em>Our</em>
eyes will look on that vast crowd.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And tell me,” continued Emma, deeply
impressed with the thought, “who is the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Judge.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Judge that will be seated
on the throne you speak
of? and what will He do?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“If you refer, my child,” said her grandmother,
“to the seventeenth chapter of Acts,
thirty‐first verse, you will there read who is
set apart as Judge of the world.” Emma
turned up the passage in her Bible, and read
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“For He hath appointed a day in the
which He will judge the world in righteousness
by <em>that Man</em> whom He hath ordained;
whereof He hath given assurance unto all
men, in that He hath raised Him from the
dead.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, I see now!” she exclaimed, as she
closed her Bible; “it is the Lord Jesus Christ
who is to be Judge. It makes me glad to
think of this; for if I love and serve Him
now, I will not be afraid to meet Him then.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Throne.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But why is it said that He
is to be seated on a <em>white</em>
throne?—will it really be so?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I cannot tell,” replied the other, “what
the <em>outward</em> marks of majesty will be in
which He will appear, although, doubtless,
these will be very great; for it is said that
He will come ‘in His glory,’ and that He is
to have ‘all His holy angels with Him.’ But
He is spoken of as seated on a great <em>white</em>
throne, to denote His awful purity and holiness;
that He will give on that day every
one his due. His mercy will not interfere
with the exercise of justice and holiness, and
sinners will not escape unpunished.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I think I now remember, dear grandmamma,”
said Emma, “of reading in that
same chapter in Revelation which speaks of
the throne of the Judge, that He is to have
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Books.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
some books lying open before
Him.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, my child, you are right; ‘the
books,’ we are told, are to be ‘opened.’
What these books may be we cannot tell;
but perhaps they may be the books of the
Law and the Gospel—the books of Conscience,
and Memory, and Privilege; and especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>the <em>Great Book of Remembrance</em>, in which all
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Book of Remembrance.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
our words, and deeds, and
actions, are preserved. All
that every individual has
ever done will be found recorded in it. Many
will wonder when they come to see how
faithful the pen of God has been in writing
down <em>all</em>;—heart sins, and tongue sins, and
life sins. I fear not a few suppose that there
are many trifling faults (or, as they call
them, ‘little sins’) which they imagine God
does not think it worth while to take notice
of. They will find every one of them recorded.
<em>They</em> may have forgotten them long
ago; but they will all be brought to light
again on that Great Day.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“If this,” exclaimed Emma, “be indeed
the case, who is there but must tremble at
the thought of that day?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“The wicked, my child,” continued her
grandmother, “will and must be afraid to
think of it. All who have not known the
salvation of Jesus, and fled to His precious
blood, must be covered then with confusion
and shame. They will then be led to see,
what they never saw before, what an evil
thing sin is, and what a holy being God is.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>But His own people will have nothing to fear.
They can say now, in the words of the beautiful
hymn—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Bold shall I stand on that great day;</div>
      <div class='line'>For who aught to my charge can lay,</div>
      <div class='line'>While by Thy blood absolved I am</div>
      <div class='line'>From sin’s tremendous guilt and shame?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Yes, dear Emma, they will be able to look up
with joy in the face of their Judge, and say, ‘<em>It
is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth?</em>’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But what! Do you mean, grandmamma,
that God does not take account of the sins of
the righteous?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No, no, my child; every one of their sins
is written down as well as those of the
wicked—dreadful pages of guilt, too, that
might well overwhelm them with wrath and
condemnation.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“How, then,” continued Emma, “can it be
different with them from the others? How
can God pass over their many sins?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“He <em>does</em> not—He <em>could</em> not, my child,”
replied the aged lady, “pass any sins over.
But you may have heard of <em>another</em> book which
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Book of Life.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
God will have before Him
on that day. It is the
<em>Book of Life</em>. There the names of all the
redeemed are written. None who are written
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>therein can be lost! It is as if the great
Judge took His pen and drew it through
every page of recorded sins, marking them
all out with the blood of the Lamb of God.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But,” asked Emma, “will it not make
the believer very sad and sorrowful on that
day to see such an awful record of sins? It
will be enough, surely, to bring floods of tears
to his eyes.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I do not wonder at your saying so, my
dear; but I think the thought of his sins will
be lost in a still more wondrous and amazing
one—I mean in thinking of the work of Jesus,
that could take <em>so many sins</em> away, making
them all forgiven and forgotten, and blotted
out for ever.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh that <em>my</em> name, dear grandmamma,
were safely written there! I feel as if I never
could be for another hour happy or joyful
until I felt sure that my name was in the
<em>Book of Life</em>!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You have, my dear child, all the assurance
necessary, if you are now believing in the
Lord Jesus—trusting in His merits—seeking
to love Him—to do what He commands—and
avoid what displeases Him. Of such He
says (<abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 5), ‘I will not blot out his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>name out of the <em>Book of Life</em>; but I will confess
his name before my Father and before
His angels.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But tell me further,” said Emma, “how
will the work of judgment proceed?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Jesus, my child, after the books have
been opened, and the vast multitude have
been brought before Him, will go on to pronounce
sentence upon each. It will be a
solemn scene. We read that ‘He will
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Awards.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
separate the righteous from
the wicked as a shepherd
divideth the sheep from the goats.’ In this
world the good and the bad, the ‘tares and
the wheat,’ are mixed up together. <em>We</em> cannot
tell the holy from the unholy; but Jesus
knows them all; and on that day He will
parcel all mankind into these two great
classes. In one or other every human being
must be placed.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“On whom will He pronounce sentence
first?” inquired Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'>“He will address the righteous first,” said
her grandmother. “It will not, indeed, be
with <em>them</em> a day of wrath. Believers, at the
time of their justification (as I explained to
you on a former evening), were dismissed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>with the sentence of ‘not guilty’ pronounced
upon them. They are brought before God’s
throne, that there they may be ‘openly
acknowledged’—receive a public acquittal
before men and angels—and listen to that
happy, happy sentence, ‘Come, ye blessed of
my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for
you from the foundation of the world.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I can well imagine their joy,” said Emma;
“but what next?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It will be a sadly different scene, my
child. Let the words of Jesus himself tell
you of it—you will find them in the 25th
chapter of Matthew, 41st verse.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Emma again turned to the passage, and
read, “Then shall He say also to them on the
left hand, Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting
fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“After this,” continued the aged lady, “we
read no more about the doings of that great
day. The court is dissolved—the trial over.
We see the golden gates of heaven open
to receive happy saints and angels; and the
miserable wicked sink down to the regions of
despair! This solemn day terminates the
kingdom of grace on earth. The kingdom of
glory is then completed.  The elect are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>gathered into it from the four quarters of
heaven. They ‘enter into the joy of their
Lord.’ But this I must reserve speaking to
you about, if God spare me, till another
Sabbath.”</p>

<h3 id='eighth' class='c018'>EIGHTH NIGHT.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Spring once more returned with its green
fields and bright sky. The little birds were
beginning to raise their earliest notes, as if
telling one another how happy they were that
winter, with its snow and its storms, was
again over, and that the fresh buds were beginning
again to appear. The small, old‐fashioned
lamp, too, which was filled every
Saturday, so as to be ready for the Sabbath
evening, was, from the long twilight, no
longer required. As the last rays of the
setting sun were falling through the latticed
window, Emma was found once more at her
grandmother’s side.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I think, my dear,” said the latter, laying
aside her spectacles, and drawing her grandchild
nearer her—“I think I left off speaking
last Sabbath when we were just beginning to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>talk of the most wondrous and glorious of
all Bible subjects.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh yes,” replied Emma, “you had told
me about the doings of the great Day of
Judgment, and you were commencing to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of Heaven.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
speak about the glories of
heaven, when you thought
it would be better to wait till now.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Truly, my child,” said her grandmother,
“I would require rather to wait till that
heaven itself begins, in order to give you
any idea of its happiness. We are told that
‘eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
have entered into the heart of man, the
things which God hath prepared for them
that love Him.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I was reading a little ago, when sitting
at the window,” said Emma, “the description
of this glorious heaven given us in the last
chapters of the Bible, where it is said to be a
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How described in
Revelation.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> great city, with streets of
gold like transparent glass,
walls of jasper, and foundations
of precious stones. And here, too, is
another beautiful verse, grandmamma,” continued
she, as her eyes glanced over the 21st
chapter of Revelation: “‘And the city had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to
shine in it; for the glory of God did lighten
it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.’ And
here yet another lovely description,” she
added, “I love so to read it: ‘And he shewed
me a pure river of water of life, clear as
crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God
and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street
of it, and on either side of the river, was
there the tree of life, which bare twelve
manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every
month: and the leaves of the tree were for
the healing of the nations.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have not interrupted you, my dear
child, in reading these beautiful verses,” said
the aged lady; “they give us a bright and
glowing picture of happiness and glory, which
our minds can in no other way conceive.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To be understood figuratively.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “But will there <em>indeed</em>
be golden streets, and
crystal walls, and all these
precious stones that are here spoken of?” inquired
Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There will be far greater magnificence,
and far purer happiness,” replied her grandmother,
“than all the gold and gems this
world could give. These are just figures or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>emblems employed by God in His Word to
convey to us some idea of the vast glory of
heaven. No earthly words, or thoughts, or
language, could describe this; and therefore,
as men consider gold and precious stones the
most costly and valuable things in the world,
they are used as pictures to give us some
feeble representation of heavenly blessedness.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What, then, dear grandmamma, will
heaven really be? What kind of a place is
it? and how are the righteous employed when
they get there?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Scenery of Heaven.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “I cannot tell,” replied the other, “what
character of scenery there will be in heaven,
nor in what particular spot
in the universe this happy
place is prepared.  The
Bible does not gratify our curiosity about
this. For anything that is known to the
contrary, there may be much there that we
love and admire in this world. There may
be beautiful skies, and clear rivers, and gushing
fountains, and lovely flowers, and sweet
music. But still, as I have said already,
regarding all these the Bible says nothing.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“What, then, <em>will</em> heaven consist in,
grandmamma?” inquired Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Negative and Positive Blessedness.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “I was just going to say, my child, that
there are many things we know will <em>not</em> be
there, and many things we
know <em>will</em> be there. Does
little Emma think she
could tell me any of the things we have in
this world that we shall <em>not</em> have in heaven?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh yes,” replied the little girl, “I
think I know. We shall have no <em>sin</em> there,
and no <em>sorrow</em> there, and no <em>death</em> there.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Negative.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Quite right, my child,” said her grandmother.
“This is a world of sin, and therefore
it has become a world
of pain, and sickness, and
sorrow, and death; but in heaven all these
will be unknown. I thought I saw you, my
dear, but yesterday seated in the churchyard
on little Robert’s tomb; and when you came
home, I observed by your eyes that you had
been weeping for the loss of your little brother.
In that happy heaven I am speaking of there
will be no graves and no tears, for there will
be no sin and no death to cause them.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But then, dear grandmamma, will there
be no other joys in heaven?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Positive.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Yes, yes, my child,” replied the aged
lady; “I have only spoken to you of what is
<em>not</em> in heaven. I have yet to tell you what
<em>is</em> there. Can little Emma
answer this question too, as
well as the last?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall meet all my dear friends there,”
said Emma—“my father and mother, who
were both taken from me when I was so
young, and little Robert, and you too, grandmamma,
who have so kindly led me on in the
way to that happy place, and told me often
how I am to get there.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“My dear child,” said her grandmother,
“all that you have said about meeting departed
friends there is true. All who are
the friends of Jesus will meet in that happy
home. I <em>believe</em> it to be true,” she repeated,
the tear filling her eye as she spoke. “Parents
will know their children, and children their
parents; and brothers and sisters will meet
never to part any more. But this is but a very
small portion of the joy of heaven. Can you
not think of a far greater joy in that bright
world than even the meeting of the dearest
earthly friends?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh yes,” replied Emma, “we shall meet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>God!—we shall see Jesus face to face!
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Vision of God.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This will be the greatest,
surely, of all the glories of
heaven—to dwell for ever with God, and discover
more of His grace and love!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, truly, my child,” said the other;
“this is to heaven what the sun is to the
universe. All the other glories we can speak
of are only, by comparison, like the light of
the stars to that sun, or like little streams to
the great ocean. We shall ‘see God;’ and
what, perhaps, is more wondrous still, we shall
be <em>like</em> God. Along with the holy angels, we
shall have no higher delight than doing His
will. We shall feel that in His presence
‘there is fulness of joy.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But shall we indeed <em>see God</em>?” inquired
Emma; “the thought seems so wondrous.
How can this be?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How God will be Manifested.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Here again, dear child,” replied her grandmother,
“we must not try to be wise beyond
what the Bible has told us; for it is there
said, that ‘He dwells in
light that is inaccessible and
full of glory, whom no eye
hath seen, neither can see.’ That there will
be some bright and glorious manifestation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>His presence I cannot doubt; but what the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Presence of
Jesus in the midst
of the Redeemed.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> nature of this will be I
cannot tell. This we know,
however, with certainty,
that Jesus, our blessed Redeemer,
in His glorified human nature, will
be seen and adored by the countless multitudes
of His ransomed people.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I saw,” said Emma, “a verse immediately
following the words I a little ago
read, which speaks of this. Here it is: ‘And
<em>they shall see His face</em>, and His name shall be
in their foreheads.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, my child; and you may perhaps
remember some other passages which tell the
same blessed truth. Do you remember what
made John so happy in the prospect of
heaven?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh yes,” replied Emma, “I recollect
now. He says with such joy, ‘We know
that, when He shall appear, we shall be like
Him; for we shall <em>see Him as He is</em>.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Quite right, dearest,” said her grandmother;
“I shall just remind you of one more.
It is the Saviour’s own last prayer for His
people—‘Father, I will that they also whom
Thou hast given me be <em>with me where I am</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span><em>that they may behold my glory</em>.’ Do you remember
the name by which Jesus is spoken
of again and again in the book of Revelation,
describing to us how He now appears in
glory?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes,” replied Emma; “I have often been
struck with the title there given to Him. He
is called ‘the <em>Lamb that was slain</em>.’ I often
wonder why He should be called so, now that
He is in heaven, seated on His throne, with
all His sufferings at an end.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is, my dear child,” answered the aged
lady, “a very precious name. It tells that
He continues, and will continue, to wear His
glorified <em>human</em> nature there, and that, too,
through all eternity. It tells us also that
the redeemed will never cease to remember
that it was to the shedding of His precious
blood that they owe every gem of their crowns.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And doubtless,” said Emma, “the happy
company of the saints will for ever delight to
think more and more of the love of Jesus?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Their Contemplation of Christ’s Love.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “You are right,” said
the other. “It will assuredly
be one of the greatest
joys in heaven to comprehend with all
saints what is the height and depth, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>length and breadth, and to know the love of
Christ, which passeth knowledge. They will
ever be trying to know more and more of this
love; but they will never be able to understand
all its meaning.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I daresay, too, much that we cannot now
understand will be cleared up?” said Emma.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, my dear,” replied her grandmother;
“God’s wisdom and faithfulness will then be
as fully revealed as His love. There is much
that takes place on earth which is perplexing
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Providences Explained
in Heaven.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> to us—what we call ‘dark
dealings,’—as, for example,
when good and useful lives
are taken away, and evil and worthless lives
are spared; but Jesus, you remember, said,
‘What thou knowest not <em>now</em>, thou shalt
know hereafter.’ I believe we shall then not
only ‘<em>know</em>,’ but <em>see</em>, that ‘all things have been
working together for good to them that love
God.’ Sore trials and afflictions will then call
forth loud songs of praise; and it will be
made manifest that the Judge of all the earth
had done right.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And will all these blessed saints,” inquired
Emma, “be equally holy and happy?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“They will all, my dear, be <em>holy</em>,” said the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>old lady, “for ‘without holiness no one could
see God,’ far less enjoy Him; and they will
all, too, be <em>happy</em>—not one tear will be in their
bright faces. But I believe, too, that some
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Degrees of Bliss
in Heaven.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> will be happier than others.
<em>All</em> will be like vessels full
to the brim with glory and
happiness; but some vessels will be larger
than others, and able, therefore, to contain
more happiness. We read that they shall
differ ‘as one star in the firmament differs
from another star in glory.’ Some stars are
of a larger size than others; some are nearer
the sun than others: so those who have lived
nearer Jesus on earth, and loved Him with
larger hearts, will be nearer Him in heaven.
While <em>all</em>, therefore, who are believers will be
happy, those will be happiest who are walking
closest with God now. If you will turn
to the twelfth chapter of Daniel, you will find
there a striking verse, telling of different
degrees of coming happiness. Here it is,”
continued the old lady, pointing her little
grandchild to the third verse: “‘They that
be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
firmament; and they that turn many to
righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.’”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“Oh! what a glorious, happy prospect,
dear grandmamma! Would that I could feel
sure of being one even of these feeblest
stars!”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How Heaven is Obtained.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “There is but one way, my child,” replied
the other, “of joining that bright company of
which we have been speaking. It is the
blood of Jesus alone that
can open these glorious
gates. But that blood <em>has</em>
opened them, and keeps them open still, to
the chief of sinners. That blessed Redeemer
seems still to stand at the gate of heaven,
and say, ‘I am the door: by me if any man
enter in, he shall be saved.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“But I feel, my dear Emma, that my
strength is failing, and I am unable to speak
more to you this evening. Give me your
Bible, and I shall double down the leaf at my
favourite description of the joys of heaven.”
She accordingly took her little grandchild’s
Bible, and putting a mark with her aged
finger at the seventh chapter of Revelation,
thirteenth verse, returned it to her again, saying,
“Should you, my child, be with me at
my dying hour, when my tongue is too feeble
to speak, remember to read to me that sweet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>passage. I have often wished that I might
have some one to read to me these words
when I pass through the Dark Valley.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Conclusion.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Little did Emma suppose that the words
which now fell upon her
ear would so soon come
true. A few weeks only passed by, when her
grandmother was laid upon a bed of sickness
and pain, which soon proved a bed of death.
The aged saint bore up under her sufferings
with calmness and fortitude. She was kept
in perfect peace, for her mind was stayed on
God. Her dear little grandchild was her
faithful companion during her last hours.
The night before her death, when she was
fast sinking, and her lips getting paler and
paler, Emma remembered faithfully the request
made to her. The tear started to her
eye as she opened her Bible, and saw the
leaf still folded down. She read it with a
trembling voice. The poor old sufferer was
able to do no more than clasp her withered
hands as the happy sentences fell on her ears.
When she had fallen asleep in Jesus, and
was laid in the churchyard which she had so
often looked to from her window, Emma delighted
to go with her Bible in her hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>and, sitting on the green turf which covered
her grave, to read the well‐known passage:
“And one of the elders answered, saying unto
me, What are these which are arrayed in
white robes? and whence came they? And
I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he
said to me, These are they which came out of
great tribulation, and have washed their
robes, and made them white in the blood of
the Lamb. Therefore are they before the
throne of God, and serve Him day and night
in His temple: and He that sitteth on the
throne shall dwell among them. They shall
hunger no more, neither thirst any more;
neither shall the sun light on them, nor any
heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst
of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead
them unto living fountains of waters; and
God shall wipe away all tears from their
eyes.”</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
